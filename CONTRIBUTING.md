## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Install dependencies** and ensure the project builds
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Run the code quality checks**

### PR Submission

1. **Create a descriptive PR title**
   - Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
   - Be specific: "Add Windows Go detection" vs "Fix bug"

2. **Write a comprehensive PR description**
   ```markdown
   ## What does this PR do?
   Brief description of changes

   ## Why?
   Explain the motivation for these changes

   ## Testing
   How did you test these changes?

   ## Screenshots (if applicable)
   Add screenshots for UI changes

   ## Checklist
   - [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
   - [ ] Self-review completed
   - [ ] Tests added/updated
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented)
   ```

3. **Link related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"

### Code Quality Checks

Before submitting, ensure your code passes:

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check compilation
cargo check
```

## üéØ Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guidelines

1. **Follow Rust conventions**
   - Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
   - Use `PascalCase` for types and enums
   - Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

2. **Code formatting**
   - Use `cargo fmt` to format code
   - Line length: 100 characters (rustfmt default)
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation

3. **Documentation**
   ```rust
   /// Brief description of what this function does.
   /// 
   /// # Arguments
   /// 
   /// * `param` - Description of parameter
   /// 
   /// # Returns
   /// 
   /// Description of return value
   /// 
   /// # Examples
   /// 
   /// ```
   /// let result = my_function(param);
   /// ```
   pub fn my_function(param: Type) -> ReturnType {
       // Implementation
   }
   ```

4. **Error handling**
   - Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
   - Use `thiserror` for custom error types
   - Provide meaningful error messages

5. **Async code**
   - Use `async/await` syntax
   - Handle cancellation gracefully
   - Avoid blocking operations in async contexts

### Project-Specific Guidelines

1. **TUI Guidelines**
   - Keep UI responsive (non-blocking operations)
   - Use consistent colors and styling
   - Handle terminal resize gracefully
   - Provide clear user feedback

2. **File System Operations**
   - Always check permissions before operations
   - Use atomic operations where possible
   - Provide detailed error messages
   - Handle edge cases (permissions, missing files, etc.)

3. **Cross-platform Considerations**
   - Test on multiple platforms
   - Use platform-specific conditional compilation
   - Handle path separators correctly
   - Consider different Go installation methods

## üêõ Issue Guidelines

### Creating Issues

1. **Search existing issues** before creating new ones
2. **Use issue templates** when available
3. **Be specific** in titles and descriptions
4. **Include system information** for bugs
5. **Add appropriate labels**

### Issue Labels

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `question` - Further information is requested
- `wontfix` - This will not be worked on

## üîí Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT create a public issue**
2. **Email the maintainers** directly
3. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time** for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure
